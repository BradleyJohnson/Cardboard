How am I going to manage all the games in my database?

Scrape and maintain vs. pure API calls


Pros for scrape




Pros for API calls
-Don't need to maintain






IDEA!!!!

Scrape all of the games from from BGG. When I ask someone to import their games,
it will call the API and collect all of the names of the games from their collection
then it will find the corresponding game model and add it to a collection

If they need to update their collection they can choose from a refresh option
which will compare their current list to their BGG list and update as necessary.




What will the Game model have?
1. name - string or symbol
2. player_count - can active record store ranges?
3. description - string
4. thumbnail - string
5. year_published - integer
6. game_designer - string

What will the Mechanic model have?
1. type - string
