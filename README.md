#Cardboard README

## What is Cardboard?
**Cardboard is a meetup facilitator, records logger and visualizer, and social platform for board game enthusiasts.**

Boardgames have been quietly resurging for a decade or more.  The Monopolies and Scrabbles of yesteryears are being replaced by new generations of complex strategic board games that do not tire even after hundreds of play. We live in a time when most social interactions involve a screen, but people still crave the thought-provoking real-life interaction that boardgames provide.

Cardboard is an application that helps stave off the the madness and wasted time that comes with from administrivia of organizing board game meetups. Whether itâ€™s a weekly boardgame meetup for the hardcore or a monthly dinner and boardgame night for a group of friends, Cardboard helps us maximize our time gaming together and enjoying company.
