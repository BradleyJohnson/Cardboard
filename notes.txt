Private messages:

Have a message model that has sender, receiver, and unread: true (default).

When a user loads their unread messages you set an ajax timeout call that will make all messages
as read by changing the unread value to false



Admin:

Add a column to memberships for :isAdmin (set to true or false) which allows the booting of users from groups.
Could potentially do :isFounder as well for enhanced privileges.
