WHERE I LEFT OFF:
  Message form creation works. Message count notification isn't working






Private messages:

Have a message model that has sender, receiver, and unread: true (default).

When a user loads their unread messages you set an ajax timeout call that will make all messages
as read by changing the unread value to false



Admin:

Add a column to memberships for :isAdmin (set to true or false) which allows the booting of users from groups.
Could potentially do :isFounder as well for enhanced privileges.


Service Objects
  Pass in group name into the service object through group_params[:name]. Controller knows nothing about group creation.
  As in, the service object should create the Group as well. That way it is fully decoupled from the controller.
  The one other thing the controller has is the typical error handling like what's seen with scaffolds. Something like:
  founded_group = FoundGroupService.new(group_params[:name], user_id)

  if founded_group
    redirect_to whatevs
  else
    do the error thing here
  end
